  |   Jump into a new Yoshi adventure in a world made of everyday           |
  |   objects-like boxes and paper cups!                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As Yoshi, you'll leap up high, gulp down enemies, and set out on a    |
  |   treasure hunt to find all the different collectables. On the flip     |
  |   side, stages can be played backwards, providing new perspectives to   |
  |   explore and new ways to locate some of the more craftily hidden       |
  |   items!                                                                |

  |   It all started when Kamek and Baby Bowser set out to steal a          |
  |   gem-set stone. Legend has it that this fabled artifact can grant      |
  |   the bearer their wildest dreams! But when the artifact's gems are     |
  |   sent flying, it falls upon Yoshi and friends to find them. Luckily,   |
  |   saving the day can be cooperative and challenging. Pass a Joy-Con     |
  |   controller to a friend to team up as fellow Yoshis. Also, Mellow      |
  |   mode gives Yoshi wings for a breezier experience, which may come in   |
  |   handy! Finding all the flowers, coins, and Poochy Pups is no small    |
  |   feat! For extra protection, suit up in one of the handicraft          |
  |   costumes you can unlock in-game!                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Explore each stage and then find even more secrets by making your   |
  |     way through the stage backwards on the flip side                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Overcome varied enemies and obstacles, like Zombie Guys,            |
  |     Skelesaurus, Ukiki, and Monty Mole as you seek out hidden           |
  |     collectables                                                        |

  |   * Pass a Joy-Con controller to a friend for 2-player cooperative      |
